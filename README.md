This project was to make sure that I had a good grasp on the basics of HTML. I learned to create relative links between pages and within directories.  My first challenge was figuring out why the photos I had chosen did not present on the webpage.  After rereading over the lines and looking at previous projects I had completed, I realized that I had not correctly gone up the branch.  I made this mistake a handful more of times, but each time I realized the mistake quicker than the last and corrected it. 

I believe the most important skill I learned through the project is problem solving and learning how to rework problems to figure just what went wrong. 

It was a lot of fun doing this project and I cannot wait to learn more!
