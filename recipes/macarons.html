    <h2>The following recipe contains steps for the Italian meringue method of making macarons. There are several ways to make them, but I believe this was is the easiest and tastes the best.
        You can use a carton of egg whites for this; However, if you prefer to use eggs you already have you can separate the yolks from the whites and use the yolks for French buttercream.

    <h4>French buttercream</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>100 grams granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp water</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>227 grams unsalted butter, room temperature and cubed</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract or flavoring of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Macaron</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Weigh out ingredients for macarons in separate containers.
        You will want to keep the egg whites separate, as the are used in different parts of the recipe.</li> 
    <li>Sift powdered sugar and almond flour together.</li>
    <li>Place granulated sugar in a small pot and add 52 grams of water.</li>
    <li>Heat the sugar-water mixture on a stove. This will take a while as it needs to reach 240 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>While sugar-water is heating, pour one of the egg whites in a bowl attached to a stand mixer with the whisk attachment.
        You can also pour the other egg whites in with the powdered sugar and almond flour.</li>
    <li>Once the sugar-water starts to get bubbly, begin mixing the egg whites in the mixer on low speed.
        You want the egg whites to have a medium peak by the time the sugar-water hits 240 degrees.
        Typically, you will start mixing it once the sugar-water is around 210 degrees.</li>
    <li>Once at 240 degrees, bring the pot of sugar over to the whipped egg whites and slowly pour while mixing on high speed.
        You will want to let it pour along the side of the bowl into the egg whites. 
        Once all the sugar has been added, continue mixing until bowl is warm to the touch, but not hot.</li>
    <li>Add the meringue to the bowl of powdered sugar, almond flour, and egg whites.
        If you want to add coloring, this is also when you will add food dye. Fold these ingredients together, making sure not to over mix. 
        It is ready when you ribbon the mixture on top of itself and it holds for five seconds before sinking back in.</li>
    <li>Fill piping bag with mixture and pipe onto sheet pan prepared with silicone mat to desired size.
        Once you have run out of room on the pan, slam pan against table a few times on each side to flatten out the cookie and get out air bubbles.
        Allow piped mixture to sit for at least one hour. Towards the end of the hour, begin heating oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>Bake cookies for 5 minutes, rotate pan and then bake an additional 5 minutes. 
        Cookies should have slight color to them and squish just ever so slightly if you touch them. 
        If they move when you touch it, bake for an additional minute and check. Repeat if still underbaked.</li>
    <li>Allow cookies to cool to room temperature before filling with buttercream. 
        When ready to fill, match halves with similar sizes so they are ready to be sandwiched after being filled with buttercream.</li>
    </ol>

<h4>French buttercream</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Combine sugar and water in medium saucepan. Heat over low heat while stirring until sugar dissolves. 
        Increase heat to medium- high and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Put egg yolks in a stand-mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat until thick and foamy.</li>
    <li>Cook the sugar and water syrup until it reaches 240 degrees F. Immediately remove from heat. 
        With mixer running, SLOWLY drizzle hot syrup into bowl with yolks.</li>
    <li>Continue mixing until the bottom of the bowl is cool to the touch and the yolk mixture has cooled to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Add in butter one cube at a time allowing each piece to incorporate before adding the next. Add vanilla and salt. Continue mixing until buttercream is smooth and creamy. (About 5-6 minutes.)</li>    
</ol>
<h3>Finished product</h3>
<p>Once the cookies are cooled and buttercream is finished, pipe buttercream onto half of the a paired cookie, then sandwich with other half.</p>
